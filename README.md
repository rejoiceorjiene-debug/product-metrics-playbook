**Product Metrics Playbook**
This repository documents common product metrics, how they should be interpreted, and the decisions they are best suited to inform.
The examples used here are based on public, hypothetical product scenarios and are intended to demonstrate metric literacy and product judgement rather than report real performance.

**Why Metrics Matter**
Metrics are not outputs; they are signals. Used well, they help teams understand user behaviour, diagnose friction, and prioritise trade-offs. Used poorly, they create noise and false confidence.
This playbook focuses on clarity, context, and decision-making.

**Core Ecommerce Metrics****
Click-Through Rate (CTR)
**What it measures:**  
The percentage of users who click on a specific element after seeing it.

**Best used when:**  
- Evaluating the effectiveness of entry points (banners, tiles, search results)
- Comparing the relative appeal of content or placement

**Common pitfalls:**  
- Interpreting high CTR as success without considering downstream behaviour
- Comparing CTR across very different contexts

**Add to Basket Rate (ATB)**
**What it measures:**  
The percentage of users who add a product to their basket after viewing it.

**Best used when:**  
- Assessing product detail page clarity
- Understanding purchase intent strength

**Common pitfalls:**  
- Treating ATB as conversion
- Ignoring stock availability or price sensitivity

 **Conversion Rate (CVR)**
**What it measures:**  
The percentage of users who complete a purchase.

**Best used when:**  
- Measuring end-to-end funnel effectiveness
- Evaluating checkout and payment flows

**Common pitfalls:**  
- Using CVR without understanding funnel drop-offs
- Optimising CVR at the expense of user trust or experience

**Average Order Value (AOV)**
**What it measures:**  
The average value of completed transactions.

**Best used when:**  
- Evaluating bundling or upsell strategies
- Understanding revenue mix

**Common pitfalls:**  
- Increasing AOV while reducing overall conversion
- Treating AOV as a standalone success metric



**Example: Retail Marketplace Context**
In a retail marketplace, improving product imagery or content may increase CTR and ATB without meaningfully improving conversion rates. This often indicates that users are attracted to the product but lack sufficient confidence to complete the purchase.
In such cases, ATB and CVR should be analysed together, alongside qualitative signals, before concluding that the change was successful.
