**Adoption & Insight Metrics – Analytics Case Study**

**Problem Recap**
In analytics products, dashboard creation and views are often treated as indicators of success. However, usage alone does not guarantee insight, decision-making, or business impact.

This creates a gap between **adoption** and **value**.

**Metric Design Principles**
- Metrics should reflect **outcomes**, not activity
- Adoption must be tied to **decision-making**, not just consumption
- Signals should discourage dashboard sprawl
- Measurement should respect user privacy and product constraints
**
North Star Metric**
**Percentage of active dashboards that lead to at least one documented decision or action within a defined time window.**

**Why this metric**
- Shifts focus from volume to impact
- Aligns analytics usage with real-world decisions
- Encourages higher-quality dashboards

**Supporting Metrics**
**Dashboard Re-engagement Rate**
Percentage of dashboards viewed across multiple sessions.
- Indicates sustained relevance
- Filters out one-off or abandoned dashboards
**
Time to First Action**
Time between dashboard creation and first meaningful action.
- Measures speed to insight
- Highlights onboarding or usability friction

**Dashboard Retirement Rate**
Ratio of dashboards archived or deleted vs created.
- Healthy signal of curation
- Reduces clutter and cognitive overload

**Interaction Signals (Proxies)**
- Comments or annotations
- Exports or shares
- Alerts or subscriptions created

These act as **proxies** for decision intent where direct tracking is unavailable.
**
Metric Definitions**
- **Active dashboard:** Viewed at least once in the last 30 days
- **Action:** Any follow-up indicating intent to use insights (comment, export, alert, share)
- **Adoption window:** 30 days post-creation

**Risks & Limitations**
- Not all decisions are explicitly logged
- Proxy signals may undercount true impact
- Executive consumers may act offline

**Mitigations**
- Use multiple signals, not a single event
- Segment metrics by persona where possible
- Pair quantitative metrics with qualitative feedback
**
Relationship to the Core Problem**
These metrics directly address the adoption gap identified in Issue #1 by redefining success as **insight-driven action**, not dashboard volume.
