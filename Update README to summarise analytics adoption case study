**Analytics Product Adoption & Insight Case Study**
A public, product-led case study analysing adoption challenges in an open-source analytics platform (Apache Superset), with a focus on shifting success from usage metrics to decision impact.

**Product Context**
Analytics products are widely adopted across organisations, but high usage does not always translate into better decisions. Dashboards are often created and viewed without leading to insight or action.

**Problem Statement**
Dashboards are created and consumed, but they do not consistently drive decisions, resulting in a gap between adoption and real business value.

Defined in **Issue #1**
**Success Metrics**
Adoption is defined using **outcome-based metrics**, not activity:
- **North Star:** % of active dashboards that lead to a documented decision or action
- Supporting metrics include re-engagement, time to action, and dashboard retirement

Defined in **Issue #2**  
Artefact: `docs/adoption-metrics.md`

**Solution Strategy**
Three solution paths were explored:
1. Decision-oriented dashboard templates
2. Insight prompts and annotations
3. Action triggers and follow-ups

The chosen approach prioritised **decision-oriented templates**, supported by lightweight prompts.

Decision documented in **Issue #3**  
Artefact: `docs/solution-options.md`

**Reflection & Learnings**
Key learnings include:
- Usage ≠ value in analytics products
- Metrics shape behaviour as much as features
- Opinionated guidance must balance flexibility

Captured in **Issue #4**
**What This Demonstrates**
- Outcome-led product thinking
- Analytics PM judgment beyond dashboards
- Metric design and trade-off analysis
- Clear decision documentation using GitHub workflows

## Notes
This case study uses public information and simulated metrics. It does not represent internal work for any organisation.
